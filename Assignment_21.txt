Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?

# Ans : A probability distribution describes how a random variable is distributed,it tells us which values a random 
#       variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely.Based on the previous data and the 
#       occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities.


     
Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?

# Ans : The difference between true random number(TRN) and pseudo-random number(PRN), is that TRN's are unpredictable 
#       physical values means (like atmospheric noise), and PRN are generated using mathematical algorithms (completely
#       computer-generated).The PRN's are good enough as they follow a uniform distribution and the seed for generating
#       PRN is unpredictable and unknown.


     
Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a "normal" probability distribution?

# Ans : A normal distribution is determined by two parameters the mean and the variance. A normal distribution with a 
#       mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called a standard normal distribution.


     
Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.

# Ans : A fair rolling of dice is also a good example of normal distribution.


     
Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?

# Ans : When trails are less, the variance will large. As the number of trials increase , the variance will reduce.


     
Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?

# Ans : random.shuffle can used to shuffle list object


     
Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.

# Ans : The general categories of math package are
#       1) Trigonometric functions
#       2)Quadratic functions
#       3)Exponential functions
#       4)Hyperbolic functions
#       5)Periodic functions
#       6)Arithmetic functions
#       7)Logarithimic functions
#       8)Conversions to Integer


     
Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?

# Ans : The exponential function is given by ƒ(x) = ex, whereas the logarithmic function is given by g(x) = ln x, and 
#       former is the inverse of the latter.


     
Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?

# Ans : 1)log2(x) - logarithmic value of x to base 2
#       2)log10(x) - logarithmic value of x to base 10
#       3)log(x,base) - logarithmic value of x to base. If only first parameter is given , it computes its
#       value tp base e,natural logarithm
#       4)log1p(x) - natural logarithm (base e) value of 1+x
